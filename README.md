# Seurat Helpers

This is a collection of additional R functions which can be used as part of an analysis using the Seurat package.

## Installation
At the moment this is just a bare R file of functions.  Once it's been developed more I will probably put it into a proper package structure.  For now you need to clone this git repository to your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/s-andrews/seurat_helpers.git
```

To use this in your script you'll then need to run the main file of functions:

```
source("seurat_helpers/seurat_helpers_functions.R")
```

You'll need to modify this path to be the absolute path to your git repository, or set your working directory appropriately so R can find the file.

## Usage

### Pseudobulk
